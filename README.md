# Pokémon Tournament League

## What the project does
This application simulates a Pokémon tournament where 16 randomly selected Pokémon from the original 151 compete against each other. Each Pokémon battles every other Pokémon in a round-robin format using type effectiveness rules (Fire beats Grass, Water beats Fire, etc.). The app displays real-time statistics including wins, losses, ties, and win rates with interactive sorting and progress bars.
